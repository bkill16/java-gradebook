# Overview

This project is a Grade Book Application designed to help teachers manage student grades effectively. It allows users to add grades, view all grades, calculate a student's total grade with letter grades, and save/load the data from files. The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of the Java programming language, including file handling, collections, and user input/output.

Through this project, I aimed to write a functional and user-friendly application that showcases core Java syntax and features while simulating a real-world use case of data management.
